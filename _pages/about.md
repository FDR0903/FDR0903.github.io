## About me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Oxford-Man Institute](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.  I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Prior to my doctoral studies, I spent five years in the hedge fund industry, engaging in research and development related to derivatives pricing and systematic trading.

My research focuses on the economics and microstructure of <u>decentralised financial markets</u> and <u>automated market makers</u>. More broadly, I am interested in combining Mathematics and <u>Machine Learning</u> to solve financial decision problems.

Outside of Academia, I am passionate about climbing, mountaineering, running, and languages. Feel free to reach out to chat about research or any of these interests!

## OMI Finance seminar
I am in the organising commitee of the [OMI Finance seminar ](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/omifinanceseminar/), which aims to discuss and promote academic and industrial work addressing the emerging challenges in finance. The seminar focuses the attention on the recent and cutting-edge contributions in economics, microstructure, monetary policy, decentralised finance, and financial technology. Contact me if you wish to attend or present.
