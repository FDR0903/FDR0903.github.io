## About me
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Oxford-Man Institute](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for five years in the hedge-fund industry, engaging in research and development related to derivatives pricing and systematic trading.

## Research

My research focuses on effectively combining elements of Mathematics and Machine Learning for financial decision problems in both traditional finance and decentralized finance, with a focus on optimal execution and market making.

## OMI Finance seminar
I am in the organising commitee of the [OMI Finance seminar ](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/omifinanceseminar/), which aims to discuss and promote academic and industrial work addressing the emerging challenges in finance. The seminar focuses the attention on the recent and cutting-edge contributions in economics, microstructure, monetary policy, decentralised finance, and financial technology. Contact me if you wish to attend or present.
