## About me
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Oxford-Man Institute](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for five years in the hedge-fund industry, engaging in research and development related to derivatives pricing and systematic trading.

My research focuses on effectively combining elements of Mathematics and Machine Learning for financial decision problems in both traditional finance and decentralized finance, with a focus on optimal execution and market making.
