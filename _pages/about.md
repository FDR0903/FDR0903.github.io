## Research Interests
#### Financial Technology
Blockchain technology, asset digitisation, and decentralised finance are reshaping the future of the financial landscape and challenging traditional stakeholders. In this context, my research primarily focuses on the economics and microstructure of <u>decentralised financial markets</u> and <u>automated market makers</u>.  

#### Financial decision problems
More broadly, I am interested in combining Mathematics and <u>Machine Learning</u> to solve financial decision problems. 

## About me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Oxford-Man Institute](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.  I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in 2023, where my [thesis](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4424010) focused on algorithmic trading problems in traditional electronic markets and in decentralised trading platforms that use Automated Market Makers (AMMs). I am currently a topic editor for the Journal of FinTech. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I spent five years in the hedge fund industry, engaging in research and development related to derivatives pricing and systematic trading. 

Outside of Academia, I am passionate about climbing, mountaineering, running, and languages. Feel free to reach out to chat about research or any of these interests!
