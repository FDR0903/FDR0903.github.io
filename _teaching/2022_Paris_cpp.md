This course introduces students to object-oriented programming by exploring the concepts of program specification and design, algorithm development, coding, and testing, with applications to designing pricing algorithms for vanilla and path-dependent options.

Aims of the course
======
Students learn how to write programs in object-oriented programming (OOP) using the C++ language. Topics covered include C++ classes/objects, input/output streams, overloading, inheritance, templates, and exception handling. Throughout the semester, problem solving skills will be emphasized and applied to solving computer problems. Experiments give  hands-on experience with the topics covered in this course with specific examples on designing code architectures for financial derivatives pricing.

Class
======
58 Master’s students, 23 hours.
