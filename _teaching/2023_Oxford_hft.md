Syllabus
======
This course introduces the optimal algorithmic trading in high frequency markets with a focus on optimal order execution in LOBs and optimal market making in OTC markets. Optimal trading problems share a common structure that will be followed throughout this course. We (i) identify a decision problem motivated by practical situations faced by market operators, we (ii) propose a parsimonious model which summarises the environment in key variables that must be considered, we (iii) frame the decision problem as an optimisation problem which can be addressed using classical mathematical tools, and finally we (iv) obtain a solution (often in closed-form) which we study through simulations and discussions.
