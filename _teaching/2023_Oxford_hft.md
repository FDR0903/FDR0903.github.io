This course covers different aspects of Algorithmic and High Frequency trading. We look at how the limit order book works and discuss how and why we could model it. 

Syllabus
======
We devise trading algorithms which take market microstructure into the account. In particular, we look at the problems of optimal liquidation/acquisition and of market making. For the former, we discuss the classical Almgren-Chriss setting with permanent and instantaneous market impact and discuss the resulting TWAP and VWAP execution strategies. We also consider a transient price impact model of Obizhaeva-Wang. This leads us to consider market efficiency and possible notions of no-arbitrage. We discuss price manipulation strategies and investigate when models allow, or not, for such strategies.
